At the Multiverse we take coffee very seriously, and so we have a great Italian coffee machine from our friends at the Espressonisten in Mitte. We use traditionally roasted coffees, mostly, and can offer cappuccinos made with organic cow's milk or with oat milk or coconut milk, as you prefer. You can order coffee to go, or enjoy drinking it at your leisure with us.
