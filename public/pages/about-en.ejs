Since he was a young Swede, Peter Selander dreamed of making a cafe and shop which would unify two of his passons, and one Swedish&mdash;candy, comics and coffee.

The Swedish people consume the most sweets of any country in the world--an amazing 16kg per person every year. Candy eating is also part of the culture for Swedish adults much more than here in Germany. Of course this means that Swedish candy is particularly high quality, and dare we say it, sophisticated. While also representing excellent value for money.

Sweden also leads the world (almost) in coffee consumption, second only to Finland with over 10kg per Swede per year. So it was natural to combine this with Peter's love of comics, and to open a comics-themed cafe and sweet shop.

The Multiverse opened in November 2021 and is open every day except Sunday. We have an authentic Swedish pick'n'mix shelf, and the very best of imported Swedish sweets. You can sit down on our beautiful sofa and enjoy some movie trailers, chill with your friends or watch your children shopping.
