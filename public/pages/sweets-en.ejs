What kind of sweets can you expect to find at The Multiverse?
<p/>
We have a great selection of the best traditional sweets in bags from Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway, and a growing selection of American sweets.

If you like to pick your own we have 60 different kinds of <em>plockgodis</em> as it's called in Sweden, also known as pick'n'mix&mdash;bags of candy you pick yourself. As you would expect there is a lot of liquorice but there are also sour, sweet, and chocolate.
